Excitings things are coming here... hold tight!

Added as a project resource the Helm charts from 'https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-kubernetes/tree/main'. We want to have a stable copy of the charts in our project. Upgrading must be taking into account in the future.

'values.examples.yaml' has some changes to make easier the configuration. I am using a go script to change the urls later in this file but it might be overengineer and it would suffice to have a variable for the URL that is later changed by the sed. This will be a future improvement
